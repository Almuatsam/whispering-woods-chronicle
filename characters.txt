Sam, a bold and curious young villager, roams the island's forests daily. While exploring a hidden cave, he discovers a worn, ancient map tucked in a stone crack. The markings hint at something long forgotten. Heart racing, Sam grips the map, ready to uncover what secrets lie beyond the trees.
Shadow first met Sam when the boy found him injured near the riverbank, a snare cutting deep into his leg. Sam freed him without hesitation. Since that day, Shadow followed him with quiet devotion. The wolf's gray coat blended with the forest, and his presence gave Sam courage. Where Sam walked, Shadow watched.
