The wind rustled through the tall oaks of Elderfall as Sam stepped deeper into the forest edge. The villagers spoke in hushed tones about the Whispering Woods, a place where paths shifted and shadows moved on their own. While gathering herbs, Sam stumbled upon a crumpled, moss-covered scroll wedged between two stones. Unfurling it, he found a map etched with strange runes and winding trails not known to any villager. A red X pulsed faintly near the center. Curiosity burned in his chest. With the map in hand and questions racing in his mind, Sam took his first step into legend.
Sam knelt beside the stream, turning the map over in his hands again. The faded edges and strange symbols stirred something deep inside him. Unlike anything he’d seen in the village books, the map showed landmarks that didn’t exist on any known path—twisted trees, sunken stones, and a symbol shaped like an open eye. One trail led straight into the heart of the Whispering Woods. His fingers paused over a note scratched in the corner: “Only the seeker may find the way.” Sam frowned. He wasn’t sure what that meant, but he knew one thing—this was meant for him.

He stood and tucked the map inside his satchel, heart pounding. The villagers warned children never to enter the deeper woods, but Sam had always felt something watching him from beyond the trees—something waiting. He tightened his boots, took a deep breath, and crossed the old fence that marked the forest’s edge. Leaves crunched underfoot as the light dimmed. Every tree looked the same, yet the map gave him direction. He didn’t know what he would find, but he felt it—his life was about to change.
Sam stepped into the Whispering Woods, and the world changed. The air turned still, heavy, and cool. Trees stretched high, their twisted branches forming a canopy that dimmed the sun. Every sound—her breath, her footsteps—felt louder against the hush. Whispers drifted between the trunks, soft and distant, like forgotten voices. Her hands trembled slightly, but her eyes stayed fixed ahead. Fear stirred in her chest, but so did something stronger—wonder. This was no ordinary forest. It felt alive, watching, waiting. She tightened her grip on the map and walked deeper, heart racing, unsure of what she’d find.
