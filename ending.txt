(tragic version)
Sam reached the heart of the woods, where ancient stones circled a crystal spring. He placed the map on the central stone, and the runes lit up. The ground trembled. The trees whispered louder. But nothing opened. The map burned to ash in his hands.

He turned to leave, but the path was gone.

The forest had shifted.

Days passed. Then weeks.

The village waited, searched, prayed.

But Sam never returned.

Some say his voice still echoes between the trees. Others say the woods claimed him for knowing too much.

The Whispering Woods kept its secret. And its seeker.
Sam followed the map to the edge of the Whispering Woods, where he faced its final secret. Some say he found a spring that blessed the land. Others believe he was lost forever, becoming one with the forest. Either way, the village never forgot his name.
