Sam reached the heart of the woods, where ancient stones circled a crystal spring. He placed the map on the central stone, and the runes lit up. The forest stirred. Trees bloomed, waters cleared, and hidden paths opened. He returned to the village with seeds, knowledge, and peace.

The harvests grew richer.

No one went hungry.

Sam never claimed power, but the people remembered who listened to the woods.

Sam reached the heart of the woods, where ancient stones circled a crystal spring. He placed the map on the central stone, and the runes lit up. The ground trembled. The trees whispered louder. But nothing opened. The map burned to ash in his hands.

He turned to leave, but the path was gone.

The forest had shifted.

Days passed. Then weeks.

The village waited, searched, prayed.

But Sam never returned.

Some say his voice still echoes between the trees. Others say the woods claimed him for knowing too much.

The Whispering Woods kept its secret. And its seeker.
